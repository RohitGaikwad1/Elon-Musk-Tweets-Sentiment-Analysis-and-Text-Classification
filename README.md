# Elon-Musk-Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Text-Classification
This project appears to be analyzing the sentiment and content of Elon Musk's tweets using various natural language processing techniques. Here is a breakdown of the main steps and components of the code:

Importing libraries: The code imports several libraries including pandas, regular expressions (re), string, spaCy, NLTK, seaborn, matplotlib, and WordCloud.

Loading datasets: The code reads two CSV files: "Elon_musk.csv" containing Elon Musk's tweets and "Afinn.csv" containing sentiment scores for words.

Frequency analysis: The code calculates the frequency of words in the 'Text' column of the Musk DataFrame using the value_counts() function and stores the top 20 frequent words in the 'freq' variable.

Text cleaning: The code applies various text cleaning operations to the 'Text' column of the Musk DataFrame, such as converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, removing numbers, removing stop words, and creating a new column 'clean_text' to store the cleaned text.

Sentiment analysis: The code calculates sentiment scores for each tweet in the 'clean_text' column by iterating over each word and summing up the sentiment scores from the AFINN-111 wordlist. The sentiment scores are stored in the 'sentiment_value' column.

Sentiment classification: The code uses NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to classify the sentiment of each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral based on the compound sentiment score. The classification results are stored in the 'review_text' column.

Data visualization: The code uses seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the sentiment values and word frequencies in the Musk DataFrame. It creates a histogram of sentiment values, a line plot of sentiment values over time, and a word cloud of the cleaned text.

Review classification: The code uses sklearn's CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer to extract features and create a document-term matrix. It then calculates the term frequency and inverse document frequency for each term and stores the results in the 'word_freq_df' and 'df' DataFrames, respectively.

Bi-gram and tri-gram analysis: The code uses CountVectorizer to extract bi-grams and tri-grams from the cleaned text. It creates DataFrames for each and calculates their frequencies. Finally, it visualizes the top 20 most frequent bi-grams and tri-grams using bar plots.

Overall, this project aims to analyze the sentiment and content of Elon Musk's tweets using various text processing and visualization techniques. It provides insights into the most frequent words, sentiment values, and n-grams present in the tweets.
